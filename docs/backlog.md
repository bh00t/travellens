## Phase 4 Hardening — Query Engine

These must be resolved before the dashboard is reliable. A wrong query = wrong widget = misleading dashboard.

> B-001 (retry loop) and B-002 (prefer fact_bookings) are DONE — see Completed.
> The system prompt was also fully rewritten this session: real column types, FK
> relationships, the two-hop fact_bookings→hotel_master→dim_location chain, date
> handling (date_id is an INTEGER key, never compare to CURRENT_DATE), and the
> city-list-is-reference-only rule. No more example-query patching.

---

### B-003 — Column name validation before execution
**Priority:** Medium  
**Problem:** Ollama generates syntactically valid SQL with hallucinated column names. We only discover this after hitting Postgres with a runtime error.  
**Fix:** After `_validate_sql()` and before `_execute()`, parse the generated SQL with `sqlparse`, extract all column references, and validate against a hardcoded dict of known table→columns. Reject with a descriptive error if any column doesn't exist.  
**File:** `ai/text_to_sql.py` — new `_validate_columns(sql)` function  
**Acceptance:** `python -m ai.main "show occupancy_rate from agg_daily_hotel_kpi"` returns a validation error before touching Postgres, not a Postgres runtime error.

---

### B-004 — Hybrid query support (SQL filter + semantic search)
**Priority:** Medium  
**Problem:** Queries like "hotels with most negative reviews but rating above 4" need both a SQL filter (rating >= 4) AND semantic search (negative review content). Currently the router picks one path and loses the other dimension entirely.  
**Fix:** Two-step pipeline in `ai/main.py`:
1. Detect numeric/boolean conditions in the query (rating, star_category, city filters)
2. SQL path fetches matching `hotel_id` list based on those conditions
3. Semantic path searches `reviews_raw` scoped to that `hotel_id` list
4. Results combined before returning  
**Files:** `ai/main.py`, `ai/semantic_search.py`  
**Acceptance:** `python -m ai.main "hotels with most negative reviews but rating above 4"` returns reviews filtered to hotels with avg_rating >= 4.

---

### B-005 — Prompt normalisation before routing
**Priority:** Low  
**Problem:** Heavy typos ("recied" instead of "received") reach Ollama as-is. The router handles them fine but Ollama may generate worse SQL.  
**Fix:** Light normalisation before routing — lowercase, strip extra spaces, optionally a simple spell-check pass using `pyspellchecker` for common hotel/data terms.  
**File:** `ai/main.py` — `normalise(query)` step before `route(query)`  
**Acceptance:** `python -m ai.main "wat r top citis by revnue"` routes and executes correctly.

---

### B-006 — Semantic search duplicate reviews
**Priority:** Low  
**Problem:** `reviews_raw` contains duplicate review texts from the Kaggle dataset. Semantic search returns multiple identical reviews at the same similarity score, wasting TOP_K slots and polluting Ollama's summary.  
**Fix:** Deduplicate `reviews_raw` on `(hotel_id, review_text)` during Phase 1 load, or apply `DISTINCT ON (review_text)` in the pgvector query in `semantic_search.py`.  
**File:** `ai/semantic_search.py` — add `DISTINCT ON` to the search query  
**Acceptance:** No two identical `review_text` values appear in the top-20 results for any query.

---

## Phase 5 — Dashboard

> B-007 through B-012 are all DONE — see Completed. The dashboard shipped with:
> widget renderer, pin to Postgres (dashboard_widgets table, not JSON), auto-refresh
> on page load, per-widget scheduled refresh, delete, and CSS grid layout.
>
> Built this session on top of the base dashboard:
> - Settings gear (⚙) popover per widget — floating, click-outside to close
> - Per-widget auto-refresh frequency (Off / 5 / 15 / 30 / 60 / 360 min)
> - Per-widget width (Normal / Full row) with live grid span
> - Refresh-all button in the dashboard header
> - Readability warning when a bar chart exceeds 20 bars (Option A — renders anyway,
>   warns, offers switch to table; never suggests line chart for categorical data)

---

### B-020 — Change chart type from the dashboard
**Priority:** Medium  
**Problem:** Chart type can only be set in the Explorer before pinning. Once a widget
is on the dashboard there's no way to change bar → table, etc. without deleting and
re-pinning.  
**Fix:** Add a third row to the settings popover: "Chart type" dropdown
(Bar / Line / Table / Stat card). On change, POST `widget_type` to the existing
`/api/widget/<id>/settings` endpoint (add `widget_type` to its allowed fields), then
re-render that widget in place. Option A behaviour: show all type options; if the
chosen type doesn't fit the data shape (e.g. stat card for a 16-row result), the
renderer shows a small "this data can't render as X" message instead of breaking.  
**Files:** `render/templates/dashboard.html`, `render/server.py` (allow `widget_type`
in settings endpoint), `render/widget_renderer.py` (graceful mismatch message)  
**Acceptance:** Pin a bar chart, open its settings, switch to table — widget re-renders
as a table without page reload and persists after refresh.

---

### B-021 — Drag-and-drop widget reordering
**Priority:** Medium — core DONE, polish OPEN  
**Done:** SortableJS added, grid sortable by header handle, `/api/widgets/reorder`
endpoint writes `display_order`, order persists on reload.  
**Open — look & feel polish:** the current drag ghost (dashed green border + 40% opacity)
is crude. Improve: a clean lift/shadow on the dragged card, a proper drop-placeholder
showing where it will land, smoother motion. Tune SortableJS `ghostClass`, `chosenClass`,
`dragClass` separately rather than one ghost style.  
**Files:** `render/templates/dashboard.html`  
**Acceptance:** Dragging feels smooth — clear lift on the held card, a visible gap where it
will drop, no jarring opacity flash.

---

### B-025 — Fixed-height scrollable table and review widgets
**Priority:** Medium  
**Problem:** Table widgets render every row, so a large result (e.g. 50 hotels) makes the
widget enormous and breaks the grid layout. The semantic widget's review list has the same
issue.  
**Fix:** Give the table body and the review list a fixed max-height (e.g. 320px) with
`overflow-y: auto`. For tables, keep the header row pinned (`position: sticky; top: 0`) so
column labels stay visible while the body scrolls. Apply in both the dashboard widget and
the Explorer preview.  
**Files:** `render/templates/dashboard.html`, `render/templates/explore.html`
(table + semantic render CSS)  
**Acceptance:** A 50-row table widget stays a fixed height with a scrollable body and a
pinned header; the grid layout is unaffected.

---

---

### B-022 — Decouple read path from compute (cache + frozen SQL)
**Priority:** High — fixes the tab-switch re-loading problem and the regeneration hazard  
**Problem (two related issues):**
1. Every dashboard load / tab switch re-runs every widget's prompt through Ollama. With
   Ollama taking seconds per widget, navigating back to the dashboard feels broken.
2. Re-running the *prompt* (not the SQL) on every refresh means Ollama regenerates SQL
   non-deterministically — same question, occasionally different query and result.

**Root cause:** the dashboard read path triggers LLM inference. In a correct design a user
request never triggers compute — reads hit a cache, compute is scheduled, the LLM authors
the query once.

**Architecture — three separated paths:**

```
Read path    (fast)      dashboard load → reads result cache → renders instantly
Compute path (scheduled) scheduler → runs frozen SQL on interval → writes cache
Author path  (once)      pin widget → LLM generates SQL → validate → freeze
```

The user never waits on Ollama or even on a live SQL query. The principle: a request never
triggers compute. This is the stale-while-revalidate pattern (CDNs, Vercel, React Query).

**Build now (right-sized stand-in for the production shape):**
1. Freeze SQL at pin time — generate once, validate, store in `generated_sql` column.
2. Server-side result cache — `last_result_json` (JSONB) + `last_refreshed_at` on
   `dashboard_widgets`. After any run, store result + timestamp.
3. Read path serves cache — on dashboard load, if `last_refreshed_at` is within the
   widget's refresh interval, embed the cached result directly (no Ollama). Only stale
   widgets re-run.
4. Refresh runs frozen SQL directly — never regenerates. A "regenerate SQL" option in the
   settings popover handles the rare case where fresh SQL is wanted (schema changed).

Note: freezing the SQL text does NOT freeze dates — `CURRENT_DATE` logic inside the SQL
re-evaluates each run, so "current month" widgets still auto-update correctly.

**Files:** `db/migrations/005_widget_cache.sql` (add `generated_sql`, `last_result_json`),
`ai/text_to_sql.py` (expose run-stored-SQL path separate from generate-then-run),
`render/server.py` (pin stores SQL; refresh runs frozen SQL; dashboard load serves cache),
`render/templates/dashboard.html` (render from embedded cache, only fetch stale widgets)  
**Acceptance:** Load dashboard, switch to About, switch back — widgets render instantly from
cache with no Ollama calls. Refresh a widget 5 times — identical SQL and result each time.

**Deferred to Phase 6 (production swap — documented, not built now):**
- `last_result_json` JSONB column → Redis (keyed by widget ID, TTL = refresh interval)
- On-load / manual refresh → Airflow `refresh_pinned_widgets` DAG running frozen SQL on
  schedule and writing to the cache
- Both noted in README as the production swap. The JSONB column is a deliberate scoped-down
  stand-in for Redis, not the intended production answer.

### B-023 — About page redesign
**Priority:** Medium  
**Problem:** Current about.html is beginner-level — basic cards, emoji icons, flat layout.
Does not match the polish of the rest of the app.  
**Fix:** Rebuild as a proper product landing page — richer visual hierarchy, real iconography
(not emoji), subtle animations/transitions, sections that match the app's design language
(green accent, mono headers, clean grid). Keep all the existing content (capabilities,
how it works, stack, data sources, disclaimer) but present it well.  
**File:** `render/templates/about.html`  
**Acceptance:** About page looks like a polished product page, not a placeholder.

---

## Phase 6 — Airflow DAGs (planned)

---

### B-013 — daily_hotel_kpi DAG
Nightly job that aggregates `fact_bookings` into `agg_daily_hotel_kpi`. Until this runs, all queries against that table return 0 rows. Blocks B-002 permanent fix.

### B-014 — reconcile_late_events DAG
Nightly job that merges `late_events/` S3 prefix back into `agg_hourly_city_stats`. Until this runs, late-arriving booking events are permanently excluded from aggregates.

### B-015 — hotel_sentiment_scores DAG
Weekly job that aggregates pgvector cosine similarity scores per hotel into a `hotel_sentiment_scores` Gold table. Enables SQL queries like "top 10 hotels by positive sentiment score" without going through the semantic path every time.

### B-016 — customer_ltv DAG
Weekly job computing customer lifetime value from `fact_bookings`. Enables loyalty and segmentation queries without full-table aggregation.

### B-024 — refresh_pinned_widgets DAG (compute path for B-022)
Scheduled job that re-runs each pinned widget's frozen SQL on its `refresh_interval_minutes`
and writes the result to the cache (Redis in production, `last_result_json` column until then).
This is the "compute path" half of B-022 — it moves widget refresh off the request entirely,
so the dashboard read path only ever reads cache. Depends on B-022's frozen-SQL storage being
in place first.

## LLM Evaluation — Model Comparison (test before finalising Phase 5)

---

### B-017 — LLM comparison testing plan: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B vs Gemma 3 12B

**Priority:** Medium — do before declaring Phase 4 complete  
**Context:** Current stack uses Qwen2.5-Coder-7B for both SQL generation and review
summarisation. Gemma 3 12B is a stronger general-purpose model and may produce
better quality summaries on the semantic path. However it is larger and slower on
RTX 3070 8GB. This item defines how to compare them fairly within TravelLens scope —
not a generic LLM benchmark.

**Hypothesis:**
- SQL path: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B likely wins or ties — it is code/SQL specialized
- Semantic summarisation path: Gemma 3 12B may win — it is better at language reasoning

---

#### Test plan

**Step 1 — Pull Gemma 3 12B**
```bash
ollama pull gemma3:12b
ollama list   # confirm both models present
```

**Step 2 — SQL path evaluation (10 golden queries)**

Run each query against both models. Score each result:
- ✓ Correct SQL generated (right tables, right columns, right joins)
- ✓ Correct result returned (spot-check against psql manual query)
- ✓ No retry needed
- ✗ Wrong column / wrong table / execution error
- ✗ Retry needed

| # | Query | Qwen SQL ✓/✗ | Gemma SQL ✓/✗ | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | top 5 cities by revenue | | | |
| 2 | cancellation rate by customer segment | | | |
| 3 | average daily rate for 5-star hotels in Goa | | | |
| 4 | which hotel received maximum bookings | | | |
| 5 | monthly revenue trend for 2025 | | | |
| 6 | hotels in Rajasthan with rating above 4 | | | |
| 7 | budget hotels in Goa sorted by avg rating | | | |
| 8 | total revenue lost to cancellations by city | | | |
| 9 | customer segment with highest average booking value | | | |
| 10 | how many bookings were made on public holidays | | | |

**Step 3 — Semantic summarisation evaluation (5 golden queries)**

Run each query against both models. Score each Ollama summary:
- **Relevance** (1-5): are the 3 themes actually about what was asked?
- **Specificity** (1-5): does it mention actual issues (e.g. "AC rattling noise") vs generic categories (e.g. "noise issues")?
- **Accuracy** (1-5): do the themes match what the retrieved reviews actually say?

| # | Query | Qwen relevance | Qwen specificity | Qwen accuracy | Gemma relevance | Gemma specificity | Gemma accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | complaints about AC not working | | | | | | |
| 2 | what are guests saying about cleanliness in Goa | | | | | | |
| 3 | rude or unhelpful staff experiences | | | | | | |
| 4 | best things about 5-star hotels | | | | | | |
| 5 | food and breakfast quality complaints | | | | | | |

**Step 4 — Latency comparison on RTX 3070**

Run each model 3 times per path, record average:

```bash
# SQL path latency
time python -m ai.main "top 5 cities by revenue"   # run 3x per model

# Semantic path latency (includes embedding + pgvector + summarisation)
time python -m ai.main "complaints about AC not working"   # run 3x per model
```

| Path | Qwen avg latency | Gemma avg latency |
|---|---|---|
| SQL generation | | |
| Semantic summarisation | | |

**Step 5 — VRAM usage**

While each model runs a query, check VRAM in a second terminal:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

| Model | VRAM used (approx) | OOM risk on RTX 3070 8GB |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-Coder-7B | | |
| Gemma 3 12B | | |

---

#### Decision criteria

| Scenario | Decision |
|---|---|
| Gemma wins SQL + fits in VRAM | Switch both paths to Gemma |
| Qwen wins SQL, Gemma wins summarisation, both fit in VRAM | Use Qwen for SQL, Gemma for summarisation (hybrid) |
| Gemma wins summarisation but OOM risk | Stay with Qwen for both, accept lower summary quality |
| Qwen wins or ties on both | Stay with Qwen, no change needed |

**Hybrid config if needed** — `OLLAMA_MODEL_SQL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL_SEMANTIC` as separate
`.env` variables. `text_to_sql.py` reads `OLLAMA_MODEL_SQL`, `semantic_search.py` reads
`OLLAMA_MODEL_SEMANTIC`. One-line change per file, no architectural impact.

**File to update after test:**
- `ai/text_to_sql.py` — change model env var if switching SQL model
- `ai/semantic_search.py` — change model env var if switching summarisation model
- `.env` and `.env.example` — add `OLLAMA_MODEL_SQL` / `OLLAMA_MODEL_SEMANTIC` if going hybrid
- `docs/backlog.md` — fill in the test result tables above and mark B-017 complete

## Developer Experience

> B-018 (CLAUDE.md) and B-019 (file-tree + Claude Code instructions in phase docs)
> are both DONE — see Completed. CLAUDE.md at repo root now also carries the hard
> rule: build all LLM-facing content from the real schema, never from memory;
> examples are a last resort, not a patch.

## Known Limitations (acknowledged, not scheduled)
|---|---|---|---|
| L-001 | `agg_daily_hotel_kpi` empty until Phase 6 Airflow DAGs | Phase 4 | B-013 |
| L-002 | Hybrid queries (SQL filter + semantic content) degrade silently | Phase 4 | B-004 |
| L-003 | Duplicate reviews in `reviews_raw` from Kaggle dataset | Phase 3 | B-006 |
| L-004 | Ollama SQL accuracy ~85-90% on real analytical queries; remaining errors are capability limits (see L-010, L-011), not prompt bugs. Prompt tuning has hit diminishing returns. | Phase 4 | B-017 (model tiering) + B-022 (pin-time verification) |
| L-005 | IVFFlat recall degrades past ~1M vectors | Phase 3 | Switch to HNSW at scale |
| L-006 | No Airflow orchestration — batch jobs run manually | Phase 4 | Phase 6 |
| L-007 | Streaming events are synthetic (Python simulator, not real PMS) | Phase 2 | Kafka Connect to real PMS APIs in production |
| L-008 | Flash attention not compiled in torch — CPU fallback for attention | Phase 3 | Update Nvidia drivers + recompile torch with CUDA 12.x |
| L-009 | Dashboard read path triggers LLM/SQL compute (no cache yet) | Phase 5 | B-022 (cache + frozen SQL), then B-024 (scheduled refresh) |
| L-010 | 7B model miscounts dimension entities — joins fact_bookings and counts booking rows instead of querying the dimension table directly (e.g. "hotels per city with no star rating" counts bookings, not hotels, and drops the star filter). Produces confidently-wrong results, not errors. | Phase 4 | B-017 (bigger model for SQL) + B-022 (verify SQL at pin time, freeze it) |
| L-011 | 7B model omits DISTINCT on plain entity-list queries — "5 customers named R" returns the same person repeated (one row per booking). Adding "unique" to the query fixes it. Capability limit, not a prompt bug; further prompt tuning regresses other query types. | Phase 4 | B-017 (bigger model) |
